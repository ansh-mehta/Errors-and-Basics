When I recently changed my github's username (i know it's silly), I struggled a lot while pushing to the repo.

Command --  [path to your git repository]>git push

Error --
git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.


A Fix that worked for me :

Command -- [path to your git repository]> git remote rm origin git remote add origin [repository's remote url]


Then after this if you try :

Command --  [path to your git repository]>git push

Now if everything is working fine then it is good to go otherwise if you encounter the follwing error: 

Error -- 
fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin master


Then, for fixing this you can try: 

Command -- [path to your git repository]>git push origin master --force

After this, you sholud be able to push/pull the repo.
