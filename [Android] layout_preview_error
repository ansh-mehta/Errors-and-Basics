I was not getting the layout preview, when i changed it's corresponding XML.
The solution I found (which worked for me) on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52520922/android-studio-3-1-4-does-not-show-layout-preview
is changing the line at Project -> app -> src -> main -> res -> values -> styles.xml : 
"<style name="AppTheme" parent="Theme.AppCompat.Light.DarkActionBar">" 
to 
"<style name="AppTheme" parent="Base.Theme.AppCompat.Light.DarkActionBar">"


Performing above steps doesn't do any good :(
But another method (which is working) is to lower your sdk version and also versions of other related files by performing

'''
compileSdkVersion 28 -> 27
targetSdkVersion 28 -> 27

implementation 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:28.0.0-alpha3' --> 27.1.1
implementation 'com.android.support:design:28.0.0-alpha3' --> 27.1.1
implementation 'com.android.support:cardview-v7:28.0.0-alpha3' --> 27.1.1
'''
